# Exercise 7
# List Comprehensions
# Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: 
# a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
# Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
print( [number for number in a if number % 2 == 0] )

# for a random list
import random

a = []
somelist = random.randint(10,20)
while len(a) < somelist:
    a.append(random.randint(1,100)) 
print([number for number in a if number % 2 == 0])
